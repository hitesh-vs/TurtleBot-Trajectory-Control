# Path Smoothing and Trajectory Following for a Differential Drive Robot

This project implements **path smoothing**, **trajectory generation**, and **trajectory tracking control** for a differential drive robot using **ROS 2** and **Gazebo**.

---

## Features

- Waypoint-based path input (CSV)
- Path smoothing and trajectory generation
- Pure Pursuit Controller for trajectory tracking
- Gazebo-based simulation
- Odometry logging for performance evaluation
- Trajectory visualization and comparison

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **ROS 2** (compatible distribution for your OS)
- **Gazebo**
- **Python 3**

---

## Repository Setup
